# `r fontawesome::fa("check-square")` Checklist.

As a student in this course and more broadly, as a member of the academic community, you are expected to respect the rules outlined in this syllabus and in the university’s academic regulations. These rules are not arbitrary; they exist to ensure fairness, transparency, and equity for everyone enrolled in the course.

At times, students may feel that their personal situation warrants an exception to one of these rules. It is important to understand that, even when such requests are made sincerely and in good faith, they are, in effect, asking for different treatment from that received by others, which amounts to altering the rules.

I recognize that such requests often do not come from a desire for unfair advantage, but from a genuine belief that the exception is reasonable. However, this often involves what is known as a *special pleading fallacy* assuming that a general rule should not apply in a particular case without an objective or institutional justification. It can also reflect a form of *motivated reasoning*, in which one interprets a situation in a way that aligns with what one wishes to be true.

I also understand that students may sometimes argue: *Yes, I understand the rules, but what’s happening to me is unfair, and I have the right to have my case considered.* As your instructor, I will always listen respectfully to your concerns. Being heard is a right. However, being heard does not guarantee that an exception can be granted. My responsibility is to apply rules consistently to ensure fairness across the board. Making individual exceptions, even with the best intentions, could compromise that fairness and create new forms of injustice toward others.

My commitment is to be clear, respectful, and fair with each of you. In return, I expect every student to approach their responsibilities with maturity, understanding that the rules are not obstacles, but essential parts of the learning environment we all share.

Please consider the following checklist to improve the chances to achieve a good performance in this course.

1.  You must read this syllabus and all linked materials. You are responsible for knowing its contents, and lack of awareness due to not reading it is not an acceptable excuse for missing deadlines, requirements, or policies. Quoting Yoda `r fontawesome::fa("jedi-order")`: *read the syllabus you must.*
1. If you think learning to code is difficult and you need more practice, take as many [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) and [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) courses as you need. Do not take a passive approach: improving your coding skills is your responsibility, and coding is a required component of this course for all students. I teach an R course every year, and you can also contact me if you need further help. You are expected to learn new things, and this is one of them.
1.  If I ever take longer than expected to answer an email or any other request, please insist and kindly remind me.
1. Always keep academic quality standards high in your work and overall course performance. Find your own motivation and maintain steady weekly progress by studying the course material in advance. This is an explicit expectation: course sessions are not improvised. Materials and activities are planned and available ahead of time, so you are expected to read and prepare before each class.
1. If you do poorly on an activity, do not get discouraged. Review your notes and the feedback/solutions discussed in class, then redo the activity on your own to identify what you missed. After you have tried again, you are welcome to contact me to discuss your work or confirm that you can now do it correctly. Students who struggle the most often stop after the first failed attempt. Do not do that. Practice, revise, and try again.
1.  If you have trouble with your group members because they fail to work under the basic standards, and you consider it unfair to include their names in the assignment cover sheet, remember you can co-evaluate them with 0 to activate a straight penalty in his or her mark.
1. This course can be challenging, and feeling frustrated at times is normal. Your well-being matters. Please pay attention to your mental and emotional health, and seek support early from me and/or university support services if you are struggling. At the same time, course policies and deadlines apply equally to everyone and cannot be adjusted case by case. The best approach is to reach out early, plan ahead, and ask for help before frustration becomes overwhelming.
1.  Remember the evaluation method is particularly beneficial for students because of how the average is calculated. Instead of simply averaging the grades, I use a weighted system for both assignments and exams. For each category, the lower grade is weighted at 30% and the higher grade at 70%. This approach ensures that stronger performance is given greater importance, encouraging improvement and rewarding effort.
