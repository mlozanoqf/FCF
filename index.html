<p>This syllabus applies to all delivery modes: face-to-face, blended, or fully online.</p>
<p>Distance learning refers to educational formats where students and instructors are not physically in the same space. Based on my experience, these courses can be just as effective as traditional in-person classes. While you may have personal preferences, I encourage you to approach all formats with flexibility. Employers increasingly value adaptability, especially the ability to thrive under changing circumstances and embrace new ways of learning and working.</p>
<p>My first experience with distance education was in 1999, and I have been engaged with it ever since, both as a postgraduate student and as a professor. My research network includes colleagues in Chile, Ireland, the UK, Italy, and Spain. Although we meet in person only once a year, we collaborate constantly through virtual means.</p>
<p>Knowing how to work effectively in online environments is just as important as doing so face-to-face. I hope my experience with various teaching formats will support your success in this course. Welcome again!</p>

<!-- This is my teaching philosophy in 100 words: *The time and the brain are resources and constraints as both restrict the amount of time available to learn. We understand this at the university, so we use these resources efficiently. Here, we stimulate our mental capacity to create and innovate by doing research; and we teach how to think and learn in a systematic and scientific manner. Here, we promote the most fundamental human values to build a prosperous society. I love teaching almost as much as doing research because every semester represents a new opportunity to further enhance our lives by learning the most given our time constraints.* -->
<p>Beyond academics, I have a passion for art, especially music and painting. I enjoy playing my Yamaha digital piano and have performed in concerts across Mexico and Europe. I have served as a keyboardist, pianist, and orchestra director, including more than a decade of musical productions with TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey (Monterrey Campus).</p>

<p>I aim to teach the kind of course I would be eager to take as a student. My perspective has been shaped by more than 25 years of experience as both a student and researcher at several universities in Mexico and Europe. These experiences have given me deep insights not only in my field of expertise but also in diverse educational approaches and learning techniques across different academic cultures. This dual exposure has taught me the importance of combining theory with practice. Relying only on theory can limit the applicability of knowledge, while focusing only on practice can weaken the understanding of core principles. A thoughtful mix of both is essential for meaningful learning.</p>
<p>In my courses, I place strong emphasis on the use of data and computer programming to develop practical skills and a research-oriented approach to solve business problems. This emphasis is not simply a personal preference, but a reflection of the growing demands of the job market. I understand that not all students enjoy learning computer programming, but it has become an essential skill across disciplines, and the university is committed to helping students develop it as part of their professional training. I seek to integrate current technologies and innovation tools so that students are prepared not only for todayâs challenges but also for the ones they will face in the near future.</p>
<p>The use of AI tools is not prohibited in my courses, as I believe it is both impractical and counterproductive to ban them in todayâs academic and professional environment. Students are expected to become familiar with these tools and learn how to use them effectively. However, this does not mean their use should be indiscriminate or unquestioned. In my experience, AI does not typically provide correct or meaningful answers to the kind of exam questions I design, which require specific conceptual understanding and critical thinking. Nonetheless, these tools can be useful for learning, exploring ideas, and improving the quality of projects when used responsibly and thoughtfully.</p>
<p>I also recognize that students themselves bring varied attitudes and circumstances to their learning. I believe that most students are genuinely interested in the subject matter, although I understand that not everyone comes to class under the same circumstances. Some may not enjoy the topic, others may be navigating difficult personal situations, and some may simply be struggling to stay engaged. I try to be mindful of this while maintaining high academic standards. I care about studentsâ mental health and well-being, and I do not believe that learning should come at the expense of anyoneâs stability or health.</p>
<p>I do not believe there is such a thing as a âbad student.â I believe all students have potential and ability, though they may face different challenges and arrive with different levels of preparation or support. My job is not to judge students by their difficulties, but to meet them where they are and help them move forward. At the same time, I also believe that earning good grades or performing well in a course is not the same as being a good person, and that the latter is far more important. Education is a powerful tool for personal and professional growth, but it should also cultivate empathy, integrity, and other higher values.</p>
<p>That said, learning is a shared responsibility. My role is to provide structure, guidance, and support, but students are expected to attend class, follow the rules, and engage actively with the material. They need to prepare, participate, and take ownership of their learning. I provide detailed plans for every class so students know exactly what to read, deliver, and when assignments are due. I design assessments not only to evaluate performance but also to reinforce understanding. I value clarity and fairness in grading, and I offer feedback as a tool to support improvement and critical thinking. While I maintain fixed course standards that all students are expected to meet, I provide the necessary support to help them reach these requirements. Clear communication is essential for the success of the course. I encourage students to contact me with academic questions or other concerns that may affect their learning. I am here to support their progress and to help them stay on track.</p>
<p>This collaborative approach works best within a structured framework. Our course operates within a clear set of rules and regulations established in the syllabus and official university documents. While I value communication and acknowledge personal and emotional challenges, I am also committed to applying these rules consistently and fairly. These guidelines exist to ensure transparency, fairness, and academic integrity. We are not expected to change or adapt the rules based on individual circumstances, and I believe it is important to uphold this principle for the benefit of the entire class.</p>
<p>I strive to maintain a professional teaching approach while remaining approachable and supportive. I love my profession, I enjoy what I do, and I am always willing to help students learn and develop relevant skills. I do not try to entertain or to be friends, but I do aim to maintain a respectful and cordial relationship that supports our ability to meet the course objectives in a constructive and professional manner.</p>
<p>Within this professional framework, I welcome and respect the diversity of student backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. This diversity enriches the learning environment and helps prepare us for working in a global and interconnected world. At the same time, I believe it is important to distinguish between valuing diverse viewpoints and maintaining academic rigor. While a range of perspectives is encouraged in class discussions, this does not mean that all answers are equally valid from a technical or disciplinary standpoint. Sound reasoning, evidence, and established knowledge remain essential. Education should promote open dialogue, but it must also be grounded in facts, analytical thinking, and a shared commitment to learning. I also encourage students to be aware of the broader social and environmental context of our actions. In my view, education should not only build knowledge and skills but also reinforce values of responsibility, including care for the environment we all share.</p>
<p>I believe that professors and students are not competitors; we are collaborators working toward a shared goal: learning. When a disagreement arises, I donât see it as a conflict. Instead, I treat it as an opportunity for dialogue. Sometimes I may be wrong, and I try to correct my mistakes openly and promptly. Other times, I may need to explain to the student, using clear reasoning, subject knowledge, or university regulations, why their understanding might not align with course expectations. I understand that my role comes with institutional authority, and I take seriously the responsibility to use that authority fairly. I try to create an environment where students feel heard, even when we disagree, and where they can trust that decisions are based on principles, not personal judgment. Disagreements donât have to become confrontations. With open communication and mutual respect, they can become part of the learning process itself.</p>
<p>As I reflect on these principles, Iâm mindful that higher education serves multiple purposes and represents different things to different people. Particularly in fields like business, finance, and economics, education is not only an academic pursuit but also a strategic investment. Whether tuition is paid by the student, their family, or a sponsoring institution, there is an expectation of value and return. As students and instructors, we have a shared responsibility to treat this process with the seriousness it deserves. That said, itâs also important to remember that education, while valuable, is not the only, or the most important, aspect of our lives as individuals. Our health, our relationships, and our character and values matter even more. I hope my students leave the classroom not only with stronger skills but with a deeper sense of what really matters.</p>

<p>Quantitative fundamentals play a crucial role in understanding modern finance for several reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1. Decision-making and risk management:</strong> Quantitative fundamentals provide the foundation for making informed financial decisions and managing risk effectively. By analyzing key financial metrics, such as revenue, expenses, profitability, and cash flow, investors, analysts, and managers can evaluate the financial health and performance of companies. This information helps in determining investment opportunities, assessing creditworthiness, and identifying potential risks.</p>
<p><strong>2. Valuation:</strong> Quantitative analysis is instrumental in valuing financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, and derivatives. Methods like discounted cash flow (DCF), price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, and other financial models rely on quantitative fundamentals to estimate the intrinsic value of an asset. Understanding these fundamentals is essential for accurately valuing securities and making informed investment decisions.</p>
<p><strong>3. Financial modeling and forecasting:</strong> Quantitative fundamentals form the basis of financial modeling and forecasting. Through these models, analysts and investors can project future financial performance, estimate earnings growth, and evaluate the impact of various factors on financial outcomes. Financial models often incorporate historical data, market trends, and quantitative relationships to provide insights into the potential outcomes of investment decisions.</p>
<p><strong>4. Portfolio management:</strong> Quantitative fundamentals are vital in constructing and managing investment portfolios. Modern portfolio theory (MPT) relies on quantitative analysis to optimize asset allocation and balance risk and return. By assessing various quantitative factors, such as historical returns, volatility, correlation, and covariance, investors can create diversified portfolios that align with their risk preferences and investment goals.</p>
<p><strong>5. Performance measurement:</strong> Quantitative fundamentals are used to evaluate the performance of investments and financial strategies. Metrics like return on investment (ROI), return on equity (ROE), and risk-adjusted return measures are derived from quantitative analysis. These metrics help investors and managers assess the efficiency and profitability of their investment decisions and compare their performance against benchmarks.</p>
<p><strong>6. Financial markets and trading:</strong> Quantitative fundamentals are integral to understanding financial markets and executing trading strategies. Market participants use quantitative analysis to analyze market trends, identify patterns, and develop trading algorithms. Quantitative factors, such as supply and demand dynamics, market liquidity, and price movements, are critical inputs for making trading decisions and managing investment positions.</p>
<p>Overall, understanding quantitative fundamentals is crucial in modern finance because it enables informed decision-making, effective risk management, accurate valuation, financial modeling, portfolio management, performance measurement, and successful trading strategies. By leveraging these fundamentals, individuals and institutions can navigate the complex world of finance and enhance their ability to achieve their financial objectives.</p>

<!-- The course incorporates a COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning) activity with students from Universidad CatÃ³lica Luis AmigÃ³ in Colombia, aiming to foster intercultural understanding among students. Econometrics is a branch of economics that utilizes mathematical and statistical methods to describe economic systems. In the context of finance, financial econometrics applies statistical techniques to address problems specific to the field. For instance, while we may know from previous courses that there exists a negative relationship between interest rates and stock prices, econometrics allows us to measure and assess the strength and dynamics of this relationship. Moreover, financial econometrics enables us to incorporate data into existing financial models, empirically testing their validity and obtaining estimates that are significantly more reliable than informal guesses or estimations. -->
<!-- Forecasting is a key aspect of financial econometrics and holds great importance in decision-making processes across various areas of a company. This course primarily focuses on forecasting methods commonly used in finance and economics. Forecasting entails predicting the future as accurately as possible, leveraging available information such as historical data and awareness of potential future events that might impact the forecasts. This subject is valuable in bridging the gap between being a student and becoming a practitioner in the finance field. We will also explore computational finance using R and Python as a means to learn financial econometrics. -->

<!-- Financial risk management involves the identification, quantification, and mitigation of financial risks. In this course, our focus is on credit and market risk models and their practical implementation using R and Python. -->
<!-- Credit risk refers to the potential loss arising from a borrower's failure to make payments on their debt obligations. Managing credit risk involves measuring the probability of default and the associated potential losses to minimize financial losses. While traditional courses often concentrate on studying firms, this course also incorporates the analysis of credit risk at the individual and country levels, providing a broader perspective and enabling the application of financial and economic analysis. On the other hand, market risk refers to the potential for financial losses arising from adverse movements in market prices, such as the prices of stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and other financial instruments. This risk is inherent in the dynamic nature of financial markets, where prices are influenced by various factors such as economic indicators, geopolitical events, interest rates, and overall market sentiment. -->
<!-- The main textbooks recommended for this course are: @Hull11 and @HullRM5, which covers influential credit risk models widely used in the financial industry; @drake2010basics, @crouhy2014essentials and @brealey2020principles, which provide comprehensive analyses of various sources of risk in financial markets; @lozanoARF, which bridges the gap between theoretical model analysis and practical computational modeling using R. Complementing these resources, @hull2020machine and @james2013introduction are recommended as additional reference books. -->

Similarly, financial engineering involves the design, modeling, and utilization of various financial techniques and instruments to develop strategies that modify or mitigate specific risk exposures. In this course, you will learn how to create quantitative financial strategies, understand financial instruments like options, and become familiar with tools and techniques used to measure risk in finance, such as value at risk and GARCH models.

The course primarily relies on the renowned textbook by John C. Hull, @Hull9, which is widely recognized as an essential reference in both academia and the financial industry. This course serves as a solid foundation for students aspiring to pursue a master's degree in Finance or seeking professional certification in the field of quantitative finance. Another valuable resource for this course is @lozanoIF, which effectively combines model analysis with practical computational modeling using R. Additionally, @goetzmann2014modern is a recommended complementary reference book as it offers a comprehensive and up-to-date presentation of modern portfolio analysis. Other useful references include @brealey2020principles, @ruppert2011statistics, and @james2013introduction, which strike a balance between theoretical aspects and practical applications.

One of the remarkable aspects of financial engineering is its ability to integrate knowledge from related fields such as computational finance, financial derivatives, and statistics, enabling innovative solutions and informed financial decision-making.

<!-- PMF. Traditional financial models, characterized by their assumptions, principles, functions, and equations, serve as essential tools for making informed financial decisions. However, by leveraging relevant technology, these models can be translated into computational code, marking the initial step towards automation and expanding the possibilities and boundaries of financial analysis. This course combines financial analysis with financial modeling, aiming to transform paper-based models into functional computational code. Proficiency in such skills is currently in high demand and highly valued not only in the job market but also in research, FinTech, and innovation projects.

The primary textbook for this course is @lozanoPMF, specifically designed to bridge the gap between model analysis and its implementation through computational modeling in R. Additionally, some recommended complementary reference books include @hull2020machine, @james2013introduction, and @ruppert2011statistics.

<!-- EFPI. \faSearchDollar \hspace{1 mm} Investment is commonly recognized as a catalyst for growth within both firms and countries. However, investment decisions can have adverse outcomes due to economic conditions or inadequate risk assessment. This course delves into the fundamentals and advanced techniques used to evaluate investment projects, which can encompass financial products such as investment funds or entire firms. Investment projects typically involve an upfront payment in exchange for future cash flows. The challenge arises when these projects fail to generate the anticipated cash flows. Evaluating investment projects helps us assess their riskiness in relation to the promised future cash flows. Through analysis and evaluation, we gain insights into how to enhance their attractiveness and distinguish between sound and poor investment decisions. Our primary textbook for this course is @brealey2020principles. -->
<!-- MPA. Economics is a social science that enables us to comprehend how resources are allocated to fulfill human needs. Unlike natural laws in physics or chemistry, the allocation of resources in economics is based on human behavior and choices. This course focuses on microeconomics, which examines the economic behavior of individual agents, such as firms. In contrast, macroeconomics studies the collective behavior of multiple agents.

Microeconomics helps us understand how individual agents, including firms, consumers, and governments, make rational decisions when faced with limited resources and unlimited wants and needs. This segmentation allows us to analyze the interactions between preferences, incentives, objectives, and constraints within each economic agent. For instance, individuals aim to increase their well-being by consuming goods and services, but they are limited by their budget, which consists of income and wealth. Similarly, firms face regulatory issues, costs, financial constraints, market conditions, and imperfect information, while striving to maximize profits. Governments, on the other hand, ideally seek to provide public goods, reduce poverty, promote welfare, and ensure a competitive environment, but they are constrained by limited tax resources and misaligned incentives.

Understanding microeconomics empowers economic agents to make better-informed decisions based on a scientific approach rather than relying solely on intuition. Since this process of resource allocation is perpetual in real-life situations, individuals who grasp the foundations of microeconomic analysis gain a significant comparative advantage in business and management. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend microeconomics early on in undergraduate studies. -->

<p>Individuals with integrity demonstrate a high level of moral character and ethics, choosing to do what is right even when faced with difficult decisions or temptations. They are trustworthy, reliable, and have a strong sense of accountability. Integrity is an essential quality in personal relationships, professional settings, and society as a whole, as it fosters trust, respect, and fairness.</p>
<p>We pledge to uphold the highest standards of honesty and integrity, both for ourselves and our peers. Violations of academic integrity, including plagiarism and cheating, are strictly prohibited and may result in consequences such as failure of assignments, failure of the course, and additional disciplinary actions as per current regulations. Plagiarism is defined as presenting another personâs thoughts or words as oneâs own, without proper acknowledgment or attribution. This includes copying from textbooks, other sources, including the Internet, generative AI tools, or any material without giving due credit to the original source.</p>

<p>I strongly advise against constructing a piece of work by simply cutting and pasting or copying material written by others into something you submit as your own. Regardless of any pressure you may feel to complete an assignment, it is important to never succumb to the temptation of taking a shortcut and using someone elseâs material inappropriately. This includes ChatGPT and other generative AI tools as this is a form of plagiarism with potentially serious consequences.</p>

<p>Ethical behavior is implicit in the course mechanics and rules, and it will be explicit in several topics throughout the course material. Following the indications of this syllabus is a simple way and a clear example regarding how we can effectively pursue ethical behavior. Ethics concerns are inherent in business, economics and finance activities because the professionals in these fields frequently manage resources to achieve a range of objectives, not exclusively maximize profits. Pursuing ethical behavior also helps us to build solid institutions, which is consistent with the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations 17 sustainable development goals</a>, <span class="citation" data-cites="UN17">UN (<a href="#ref-UN17" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. Managing own or third-party resources entails a high degree of responsibility because people often face the alternative to apply unethical strategies to achieve their own interests. A proper discussion of the ethical aspect in the decision-taking process including conflict of interests is necessary to increase the awareness of young professionals like you. In the end, following an ethical code as a business practice can contribute to strengthening or building your own reputation â one of the most significant assets you have, or are currently building.</p>

<p>Integrity is particularly crucial in the realm of finance professionals due to the following reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Trust and credibility.</strong> Finance professionals handle sensitive financial information, make critical financial decisions, and often act as stewards of other peopleâs money. Integrity is essential to establish and maintain trust and credibility with clients, investors, and stakeholders. Clients need to trust that their financial advisor or accountant will act in their best interests, provide accurate information, and handle their funds responsibly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ethical responsibility.</strong> Finance professionals have a significant ethical responsibility to act in an ethical and responsible manner. They must adhere to ethical codes of conduct, such as those set by professional organizations, and follow legal and regulatory requirements. Acting with integrity ensures that financial professionals prioritize ethical behavior, avoid conflicts of interest, and make decisions that are in the best interest of their clients or organizations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Confidentiality and privacy.</strong> Finance professionals often have access to confidential financial information, including personal and sensitive data. Integrity is crucial in maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of this information. Professionals must handle financial data responsibly, protect client information, and maintain the highest standards of confidentiality and data security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk management.</strong> Financial decisions and transactions involve risks, and integrity plays a critical role in managing these risks. Acting with integrity helps finance professionals accurately assess and communicate risks to clients or stakeholders. It involves being honest about the potential risks involved in investments, disclosing relevant information, and ensuring transparency in financial reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compliance and regulatory requirements.</strong> Finance professionals must adhere to various legal and regulatory requirements in their work. Integrity is essential in complying with these regulations, reporting accurate financial information, and avoiding fraudulent or deceptive practices. Acting with integrity helps professionals maintain compliance with laws such as anti-money laundering regulations, financial reporting standards, and tax laws.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Professional reputation.</strong> The finance industry relies heavily on reputation and credibility. Finance professionals with a reputation for integrity are more likely to attract clients, secure partnerships, and build long-term relationships. Conversely, a lack of integrity can quickly damage a professionalâs reputation and have long-lasting negative consequences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Industry ethics and public trust.</strong> The finance industry plays a significant role in the economy and society at large. Maintaining integrity within the industry is crucial for public trust and confidence in the financial system. Finance professionals with integrity contribute to the overall reputation and trustworthiness of the industry, helping to foster a healthy and reliable financial environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, integrity is vital for finance professionals to establish trust, uphold ethical standards, protect confidentiality, manage risks, comply with regulations, maintain a strong professional reputation, and contribute to the overall integrity of the finance industry.</p>

<p>I am certified as âcarbon literateâ by the <a href="https://unfccc.int/">UN Climate Change Conference</a> and <a href="https://www.coventry.ac.uk/">Coventry University</a>. The certification represents a robust understanding of the climate context and a commitment to recognizing ways to adjust our behavior to reduce our carbon footprint, as well as influencing our social and professional circles. My view is that one way of achieving a positive impact on the environment and society is to learn more about sustainable finance.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/index_en">European Commission</a>, sustainable finance refers to the process of taking environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into account when making investment decisions in the financial sector, leading to more long-term investments in sustainable economic activities and projects. Environmental considerations might include climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as the environment more broadly, for instance the preservation of biodiversity, pollution prevention and the circular economy. Social considerations could refer to issues of inequality, inclusiveness, labour relations, investment in human capital and communities, as well as human rights issues. The governance of public and private institutions â including management structures, employee relations and executive remuneration â plays a fundamental role in ensuring the inclusion of social and environmental considerations in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>In this course, you will be exposed to an introduction about sustainable finance, climate change and green economy. In particular, you will acquaint yourself with the basic skills and tools for applying the sustainable finance mechanisms to a real-world policy or business context.</p>
<p>Learning materials are taken from The One UN Climate Change Learning Partnership <a href="https://unccelearn.org/">UN CC:Learn</a>, which is a joint initiative of more than 30 multilateral organizations helping countries to achieve climate change action both through general climate literacy and applied skills development. <a href="https://unccelearn.org/">UN CC:Learn</a> provides strategic advice and quality learning resources to help people, governments and businesses to understand, adapt, and build resilience to climate change.</p>

<p>Data science is the study of extracting generalizable knowledge from data. Being a data scientist requires an integrated skill set that encompasses operations research, statistics, and computer science, along with a solid understanding of formulating problems in specific fields to achieve effective solutions. This course aims to introduce you to this rapidly growing field and equip you with its basic principles, tools, and general mindset within the context of business. Ideally, you will learn to apply financial and economic concepts, models, techniques, and tools to analyze various aspects of data science practice. This includes data collection and integration, exploratory data analysis, descriptive and predictive modeling, visualization, evaluation, and effective communication. For a comprehensive introduction to the application of data science in finance, I recommend referring to <span class="citation" data-cites="hull2020machine">Hull (<a href="#ref-hull2020machine" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>In this course, the goal is not to become a data scientist, but rather to lay the foundation for further specialization in this field through postgraduate studies. Nowadays, many undergraduate students recognize the need for basic knowledge in data science and machine learning to thrive in a world where these areas have an increasing impact on job opportunities. In the past, computer literacy was essential for all executives. Today, executives are expected to be comfortable managing large data sets and collaborating with data science professionals to drive innovation and enhance productivity.</p>
<p>Learning these computational skills aligns with the purpose of developing STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) skills during your undergraduate studies in business. For more information on STEAM skills, you can refer to <span class="citation" data-cites="boon2019exploring">Boon Ng et al. (<a href="#ref-boon2019exploring" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>. In my opinion, learning opportunities for undergraduate students should include authentic tasks that are grounded in real-world business contexts. Authentic tasks typically involve ill-defined problems, complex or multi-step questions, multiple approaches to problem-solving, and sub-tasks that integrate across disciplines. This course incorporates some of these STEAM principles and ideas into various learning activities.</p>
<p>Data science has a strong connection with finance and economics. In this course, we will explore the integration of data science concepts and tools within the context of <em>digital humanities</em>. Digital humanities is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses research, teaching, and innovation at the intersection of computing and various humanities disciplines, including economics and finance. It is inherently methodological and encompasses the investigation, analysis, synthesis, and presentation of information in electronic form. Digital humanities studies the impact of these digital media on the disciplines in which they are utilized and examines the contributions of these disciplines to our understanding of computing. If you are interested in delving deeper into the concept of digital humanities and exploring the ongoing vibrant discussions in this field, I recommend referring to <span class="citation" data-cites="klein2019debates">Klein and Gold (<a href="#ref-klein2019debates" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>.

<p>I understand that learning programming may seem challenging and frustrating at first for some people. If this is your case, I want to assure you that it is not as difficult as it may initially appear. In fact, it can be an incredibly rewarding experience that opens up a whole new world of possibilities. By learning programming languages like R and Python, you will gain access to free and open-source software that is supported by a generous online community. This community is always ready to assist and provide guidance, making your learning journey much easier. Additionally, you will discover the incredible advancements in scientific document production that come with these tools, offering limitless possibilities compared to commercial software.</p>
<p>For a university student new to programming, using AI-based assistants for R and Python coding can significantly boost productivity and enhance the learning experience. AI assistants provide real-time code suggestions, autocomplete features, and immediate feedback, which can help beginners write code more efficiently and with fewer errors. These tools can also guide students through best practices and advanced concepts, accelerating their learning curve. Additionally, AI-powered error detection and debugging can be invaluable for new programmers, helping them identify and fix mistakes quickly, thereby deepening their understanding of coding principles. The ability to refactor code efficiently and maintain consistency across projects can further instill good coding habits and standards, making the transition from learning to real-world application smoother.</p>
<p>However, there are potential drawbacks to consider. Over-reliance on AI assistants might hinder the development of essential problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of programming concepts. Students might become too dependent on automated suggestions and fail to engage deeply with the code they are writing. Moreover, AI suggestions are not always accurate or contextually appropriate, and inexperienced programmers might struggle to discern which recommendations to follow. Itâs important to note that AI tools tend to be more effective when users already possess some programming skills, as they can better evaluate the AIâs suggestions and integrate them appropriately. Additionally, the learning curve associated with integrating and using AI tools effectively, along with potential costs for advanced features, might be challenging for students with limited resources. Balancing the use of AI assistants with traditional learning methods is crucial to develop both practical skills and a robust understanding of programming.</p>

<p>The use of ChatGPT and other virtual assistants or generative AI tools in course activities is not prohibited for two main reasons. First, it would be impossible to ban them due to their easy access and the fact that they are present and integrated into a significant number of applications. Second, it would be equivalent to banning one of the technologies that is most transforming the way people work, and the job market would expect graduates to be familiar with and skilled in using such tools.</p>
<p>However, just because their use is not prohibited in the course does not mean it should be indiscriminate or used for everything without questioning. Based on my experience, and that of students who have taken the course, using ChatGPT does not guarantee a good grade. The main reason is that such tools, according to their own documentation, can make mistakes, especially when the task we ask is tied to a specific database, particular conditions dictated by the course materials, and specific methodologies and procedures of the course. Using these tools might give the false impression that they can infallibly solve class questions and activities, but that is not the case for the reasons mentioned.</p>
<p>My recommendation is that these tools can be very useful for studying, learning, and improving the status of projects and assignments, but using them as a substitute for the studentâs own reasoning is not advisable and will most certainly be reflected in low grades.</p>

<p>Throughout your undergraduate studies, you will be expected to acquire proficiency in various commercial software programs, such as Microsoft Excel, SPSS, STATA, E-Views, and many others. I strongly encourage you to develop your skills in these programs, particularly if their usage is required by your professor. However, it is crucial to recognize that these programs are owned by private firms and primarily focused on generating value for their shareholders. Consequently, there is no guarantee that the associated file formats will remain accessible or even exist in the future, which can adversely impact reproducibility.</p>
<p>While I will never discourage you from learning commercial software programs like the ones mentioned above, I also want to emphasize the alternative option of learning and utilizing user-oriented computer languages, such as R or Python, for conducting rigorous data analysis in the fields of economics and finance. These languages are supported and continuously enhanced by a large and active scientific community, providing a plethora of online resources to support eager beginners like yourself.</p>
<p>Commercial software products like the ones mentioned above are undoubtedly important in the job market. However, it is crucial to recognize that the primary interaction with these programs relies on using a mouse to navigate through pre-defined, limited, and inflexible menus. This type of user interaction is often fleeting and unrecorded, resulting in many of the choices made during a quantitative analysis going undocumented. This lack of documentation poses significant challenges as it becomes difficult to trace the steps taken during an analysis and hampers the ability to replicate or extend the analysis in different contexts. In contrast, coding enables us to conduct and produce reproducible research. Learning how to code is akin to writing a cooking recipe, where each time you execute the code, the desired outcome is achieved. If you want to change the flavor from vanilla to chocolate, you do not need to start the entire process from scratch. Instead, you can simply modify the flavor parameter from vanilla to chocolate, execute the code, and voilÃ !</p>
<p>Commercial software products often come with high licensing fees and rely on opaque âblack boxesâ â systems or processes where the internal workings are hidden or unknown â to generate a range of results. These black boxes pose a problem as they provide little insight into the underlying assumptions and procedures used to produce the final outcomes. Users may be left with a false impression that they can perform data analysis without fully understanding the intricacies involved. While this convenience may have its place in specific and limited scenarios, it hinders the exploration and customization necessary for innovative and improved applications.</p>
<p>In contrast, embracing languages like R and Python provides a versatile alternative to point-and-click programs. With these languages, you can write scripts to program algorithms for economic and financial analysis and visualization. By delving into the details of the computation, you gain a deeper understanding of the process and unlock possibilities for customization and innovation.</p>
<p>In light of this, I encourage you to embrace the shift from clicking to scripting. Look at this video to find out:</p>

<p>A web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an online platform that provides developers with a suite of tools for writing, editing, debugging, and testing code directly within a web browser. Unlike traditional desktop IDEs, web-based IDEs require no local installation and can be accessed from any device with internet connectivity. These platforms often support multiple programming languages and come equipped with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, version control integration, and collaborative editing.</p>
<p>Some examples of cloud IDE:</p>
<p><a href="https://deepnote.com/">Deepnote</a> is a cloud-based data notebook that offers a new kind of collaboration, compatible with <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>. With Deepnote, you can easily work on your data science projects in real-time and in one centralized location with your colleagues.</p>
<p><a href="https://colab.google/">Google Colab</a>, short for Google Colaboratory, is a free, cloud-based platform that allows users to write, run, and share Python code within a Jupyter notebook environment. It is particularly popular for data science, machine learning, and deep learning tasks, as it provides easy access to powerful computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs, without requiring any setup. Users can import and work with datasets from various sources, integrate with Google Drive for storage, and use a wide range of Python libraries. Colab facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple users to work on the same notebook simultaneously and share their work easily. It is widely used in both educational and research settings for prototyping, experimentation, and collaborative projects.</p>
<p>DataLab from <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">DataCamp</a> is an interactive coding environment designed for learning and practicing data science and analytics skills.

RStudio also includes integrated support for version control systems like Git, making it easier to manage and collaborate on projects. Additionally, it supports the development of R Markdown documents, Shiny web applications, and interactive dashboards, allowing users to create and share dynamic and reproducible reports. RStudio is also Quarto-friendly, enabling the creation of multi-format documents and reports. Furthermore, it supports the use of Python, allowing users to seamlessly integrate Python code and libraries into their workflows, making RStudio a versatile and powerful platform for data science and analytical tasks.</p>
<p>The main difference between R and RStudio is that R is the core programming language, while RStudio serves as the user-friendly integrated development environment (IDE) for developing data science projects. When working with R, you will need to download and install both R and RStudio. However, you will primarily use RStudio as your interface for coding in R. Behind the scenes, your computer will utilize the R program to execute the calculations. Moreover, RStudio is free and offers the convenience of seamlessly integrating multiple programming languages, such as R and Python, within a single data science project. This feature is particularly useful when collaborating with a team proficient in different programming languages.</p>
<p>In this course, you will be asked to complete graded activities (homework assignments and exams) using the cloud based alternatives, specifically DataCampâs DataLab. However, you are required to install RStudio in your own computer.</p>

I may need some volunteers to help other fellow students install RStudio and ensure that it can run both R and Python code on their own computers. These volunteers may need to familiarize themselves by reviewing YouTube tutorials on how to correctly install it on PC and Mac. Volunteers need to demonstrate that they have successfully assisted other students enrolled in this class in completing their installations. I will assign one sticker to each volunteer for every group of three students they provide help to. The evidence must be uploaded in the discussion forum (first partial) before our first partial exam. Here is a sample of valid evidence: -->
<!-- ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics('./proof.jpg') -->
<!-- ``` -->
<p>Please note that there are other alternatives to RStudio like <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. If you were to ask, my personal favorite is RStudio. In fact, I created this syllabus using RStudio with R markdown and Quarto, and it is hosted in GitHub pages.</p>

<p>You may be aware that just a few years ago, economic agents with privileged access to information had a clear comparative advantage in business and decision-making. However, thanks to technology, information and data are now widely accessible, eradicating the possibility of gaining a competitive edge solely through information access. With data availability no longer being a distinguishing factor, knowledge has emerged as a critical aspect in business. In the present day, it is not merely about having access to information; rather, it is about understanding how to leverage the increasing volume of data to create value in business. Manipulating and transforming data into valuable business tools and informed decisions has become an essential skill for all business professionals.</p>
<p>I understand learning programming languages could represent a source of uncertainty and stress for some of my students. This is why I have developed and gathered a vast amount of varied and free resources to learn R and Python in the reference section of this syllabus. In fact, you have more free resources that you need in the semester. It is true that you will have to learn a few things on your own, and it is true you will have to investigate to learn some other things. You are expected to learn how to learn as well and as quickly as you can because in the job market you need to constantly learn and apply new knowledge, and solve problems that currently do not exist. A competitive graduate is not the one who learns what was taught in class, a competitive graduate is the one who also manages to learn how to learn.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that university is a time for learning and exploring new things. Learning new languages like R and Python is just one aspect of this educational journey. While it may require some time and effort initially, the benefits and knowledge gained far outweigh the investment. These skills will not only enhance your academic experience but also provide you with valuable tools for future endeavors. It is common to face temporary frustrations during the learning process, but I encourage you not to let them dampen your enthusiasm and hinder your overall learning experience at university. Embrace the challenges, seek help when needed, and remember that the rewards of mastering programming languages are well worth the initial difficulties.</p>
<p>In my opinion, English serves as the predominant language for conducting research and engaging in business endeavors. Mathematics and statistics act as languages that enable us to comprehend the workings of nature. Computer languages, on the other hand, facilitate direct communication with computers, enabling us to conduct statistical experiments within the business context. Considering that computers are an integral part of our lives, it is essential to learn how to communicate with them not only at a basic user level but also at a programmer level. As aspiring professionals, it is crucial to distinguish ourselves from our peers and prepare for the changing conditions of the job market, particularly in the field of financial economics. In my perspective, it is vital for individuals to strive for proficiency in these three forms of interaction with our environment, irrespective of their specific professional business expertise: English, mathematics, and coding.</p>
<!-- ## R markdown. -->
<!-- You may be quite familiar with using MS-Word to produce reports. The process is simple as you start with a MS-Word document and your final result is a MS-Word or perhaps a PDF document. However, taking a pdf file and converting it into a webpage or MS-Word document is not that easy as it requires a lot of editing. In fact, this is usually a painful and timely process. RStudio allow you to produce professional documents in a wide variety of types including finished web page, PDF, MS Word document, slide show, presentations, handout, book (see for example <https://otexts.com/fpp3/>), dashboard, package vignette, shiny applications (see for example <https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/>), scientific articles, academic thesis, among others. R markdown files have an rmd extension and this source file can be easily converted into a wide and growing different and convenient alternatives as listed above. -->
<!-- ![](syllabus.png){width="100%"} -->
<!-- You will use RStudio not only to write your R code in this course, but also to produce (typesetting) the whole PDF assignment reports that you will submit. There is an online course in Datacamp called Reporting with R Markdown (Amy Peterson). If you have not taken it yet, I strongly recommend you to complete it as soon as possible. -->
<!-- A typical assignment report in my courses is a PDF document with a simple cover page, introduction (text), content (text, tables, figures, R code), conclusion (text), and references if applicable. In this course you will write the whole assignment report in RStudio, using the R Markdown package to produce the PDF final document. This is, knit a rmd file into a PDF. This task is not minor. For starters, this means that you will need to get familiar with \LaTeX, a high-quality typesetting system, to create your assignment reports. As an example, in \LaTeXÂ you type: `$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$` and the PDF output looks like this: -->
<!-- $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$, or this $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$. -->
<!-- \LaTeXÂ is a computer programming language used for typesetting technical documents, and fortunately RStudio and R Markdown makes it easier to deal with \LaTeX. Learning how to use R Markdown to write formal reports is not an insignificant format issue; it is rather an opportunity to get to know and develop a new branch of skills that are very well aligned with the fourth industrial revolution and with the free data science technology. Eventually, you will learn that creating scientific documents that integrate code, output and analysis with R Markdown is easy if you use RStudio. See @xie2020r for a complete reference about R Markdown. -->
<!-- R Markdown requires you to download and install the full version of MiK\TeXÂ  which is available here <https://miktex.org/download>. Please see <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/> and <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html> for further details on this topic. -->
<!-- Installing the full version of MiK\TeXÂ can be troublesome if you are not quite familiar with software installation. For this reason, Yihui Xie created a package in R that essentially does everything automatically: Tiny\TeX. I use MiK\TeXÂ and I am not familiar with Tiny\TeX. However, it seems like a good alternative according to my students. I added a YouTube video that explains how to install Tiny\TeXÂ in the reference list by the end of this syllabus. Most of my students use Tiny\TeX and they have had no issues at all. -->
<!-- It is common to get error messages when trying to produce an R Markdown PDF in RStudio, and people might find it hard to get the PDF done especially if this is their first time dealing with \LaTeX. In this respect, my best advice is to Google your question or the error message to find out the answer to your specific case. Fortunately, there is a very kind and growing community online that helps each other in a wide variety of data science topics at all levels of expertise. In my case, every time I have a question about programming, I find my answer online. I am not suggesting to Google the questions of your learning activities, but to Google how to deal with specific programming issues or specific error messages.  -->
<!-- ## \faGithub \hspace{1 mm} GitHub. -->
<!-- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large software projects with speed and efficiency. GitHub is the user-friendly interface of Git. Just as RStudio is a user-friendly interface of R. Therefore, you need to download and install Git (<https://git-scm.com/>) in order to sign up for a GitHub account. I use the web based client of GitHub, although others prefer the GitHub desktop version. I consider you will be OK with the web based client as well. -->
<!-- GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code and projects. GitHub is one of the world's largest communities of open source code developers. It fosters collaboration and communication between developers similar to a social network of coders. GitHub has a number of useful features that enable development teams to work together on the same project and easily track changes made by collaborators, and create new versions of software without disrupting the current versions. In this sense, GitHub is similar to Google Docs, but far, far more powerful and flexible. -->
<!-- I recommend you to use GitHub in your team in order to collaborate on your own homework assignments that require coding. My PEF students are required to use GitHub to collaborate on their project. -->
<!-- ## R, RStudio, R markdown, \LaTeX, Git, GitHub. -->
<!-- At this point you should be wondering how you are going to work with all these new software, languages and interfaces. First, you have to download and install the main base programs which are R and Git. There are some YouTube installation guides available at the end of this document, if you find better/newer videos please let me know to update this section. Second, you have to download and install RStudio and sign up for a free GitHub account. Third, you have to install the Tiny\TeXÂ and the R markdown packages in RStudio so you can create your PDF assignment reports. You will work in your local computer using RStudio, and you will produce rmd files which will allow you to produce PDF documents. You will also have to collaborate so here comes the fourth step. Fourth, you have to learn how to integrate RStudio with GitHub. You have some nice YouTube videos to explain how to deal with this integration at the end of this document. This RStudio and GitHub integration will allow you to collaborate with others. Fifth, during all these steps you will need to take some DataCamp courses that can help you to learn how to code in R. In the course calendar you can see a list of courses that you will need to take in this course. -->
<!-- It is common that some students get familiar very quickly with these previous steps, especially with the installation steps. If you are one of those, I may need your help to assist other students that struggle with the download and installation process. If you are interested in helping me with this, please contact me and I can compensate for your extra work with stickers (see what they are later in this syllabus). Your job will be to help me with the questions I may receive throughout the semester. -->

<p>Academic resources encompass a wide range of materials, tools, and sources of information specifically designed to support and enhance learning, research, and scholarly pursuits in an academic setting. These resources play a crucial role in facilitating knowledge acquisition, promoting critical thinking, and advancing scholarly activities within the academic community.</p>

<p>Here is a list and description of the available resources to help you learn the subject. My advice is to utilize as many resources as possible, as they will enable you to grasp the subject matter and develop the necessary professional competences.</p>
<p><strong>Professor.</strong> I have extensive experience as an academic and researcher, along with numerous postgraduate studies. I am willing to assist you in better understanding the course topics. If you need any help, feel free to contact me <tt><code>&lt;martin.lozano@udem.edu&gt;</code></tt> and follow my advice.</p>

<p><strong>Groups.</strong> Exams and homework assignments (see <a href="#sec-activities" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;5</a>) are group-based, so your team will be an important part of your academic support throughout the course.</p>
<p><a id="sec-gp" href=""></a> <i class="fa-file-signature fa-solid" role="presentation" aria-label="fa-file-signature icon" style="color: red;"></i> Groups policies.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Groups are formed with no more than four students. Group activities can be completed by one, two, three, or four students. Group formation is done by the students at the beginning of the semester.</li>
<li>A group member may switch groups as long as the members of both the group they are leaving and the group they wish to join agree and express their consent in writing; an email will suffice. Additionally, I must authorize the change to ensure the number of members per group does not exceed the limit. All requests to change groups must be submitted no later than one week before the next partial or final exam. Requests received after this deadline will not be considered and will be rejected.</li>
<li>I strongly advice that your team establish clear rules and put in writing the reasons that could justify a penalty in the coevaluation. These types of agreements should be managed within the team; I do not intervene in these matters because I consider them internal, and I believe each team can work in its own way. I do not change coevaluation marks.</li>
<li>In the event that the team decides to expel a member, this action may proceed only if there is clear evidence that a previously signed team agreement explicitly allows for such a decision. If there is no such agreement and/or no clear supporting evidence, I am unable to authorize the expulsion.</li>
<li>Having written team rules is especially important when students do not know each other. Clear rules provide certainty and shared expectations for all team members. While most teams collaborate well and many students build new friendships through this process, the coevaluation is a critical part of graded activities, so it is better to define these rules from the beginning.</li>
<li>If a group member performs poorly, the rest of the group may use coevaluation to ensure the individual grade is more accurately assigned. Coevaluation is a crucial component of group work. A coevaluation score of zero assigned to a student will directly result in a zero as their individual grade for that activity. Therefore, students are strongly encouraged to participate actively and contribute meaningfully to their groupâs work.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Class sessions.</strong> During our class sessions, we will explain and discuss specific topics, address questions, review your study progress, and occasionally conduct brief activities. Please keep in mind that the time available during class sessions is limited, and we may not be able to cover every topic in full detail. To ensure comprehensive coverage, we will utilize other resources and learning activities. It is expected that you attend on time, actively participate, and engage in our discussions. I recommend using your computer during the sessions as you may need to access an IDE, view the PDF textbook, or refer to your own homework.</p>
<p>For Zoom sessions, you have the option to keep your camera either on or off, as we will often be sharing the screen during class, or you will be doing an activity. To provide convenience, unless otherwise specified, class Zoom sessions will be recorded and made accessible to you. Please note that occasional internet service disruptions during class sessions are a risk we all face. The Zoom link to join the class can be found in Blackboard and in <a href="#sec-schedule" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;7</a>.</p>
<p><a id="sec-tp" href=""></a> <i class="fa-file-signature fa-solid" role="presentation" aria-label="fa-file-signature icon" style="color: red;"></i> Tardiness policies:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In face-to-face classes, three tardies count as one absence. Tardies accumulate over the course of the semester. A tardy is recorded if the student arrives immediately after attendance is taken and remains for the rest of the class. If a student is marked as present or tardy, this can be changed to an absence if they leave the classroom or do not stay until the end of the class.</li>
<li>If the class is online, there is no tardiness policy. Attendance will be based on the Zoom activity log, which shows how many minutes each student remained connected during the session. Because there is no tardiness policy in online classes, each session will result in either an attendance or an absence being recorded. If a student is not connected for the entire class, or at least for the vast majority of it, the session will be marked as an absence. To ensure accurate tracking, it is essential that you join each class using your own Zoom login credentials. This is the only way to verify your identity and correctly attribute your attendance.</li>
<li>In face-to-face classes, we usually hold a few Zoom sessions during the semester (see <a href="#sec-schedule" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;7</a> for details). During these sessions, the tardy policy is the same as in online classes.</li>
<li>In face-to-face classes, while some sessions may be conducted online as part of the course design, I allow my students to attend the designated face-to-face sessions via Zoom once per semester as an exception. If this applies to you, please notify me by email. If it happens a second time, the student may still attend via Zoom, but I will record an absence in accordance with current university regulations.</li>
<li>With respect to the maximum absences policy, we will adhere to the current university regulations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please watch the following video for a valuable recommendation from Prof.&nbsp;Fleisch, which is applicable to both online and face-to-face sessions:</p>

<!-- **Audio files (if available).** I explain part of the course material with my *sweet melodic* voice. Some students might have difficulties at understanding the required readings and I believe these mp3 audio files are useful to better understand some topics. It is compulsory to listen to them before the class session. Please note that not all the course material is discussed in audio files, for this reason you are not supposed to listen to audio files and ignore the rest of the course material, all resources complement each other. Audio files are not listed in the course calendar, but it will be easy for you to identify which audio file corresponds to each course topic. -->
<p><strong>Review sessions.</strong> We have review sessions for assignments and exams, which take place before the homework assignment submission deadline and prior to the exams. These sessions provide a great opportunity to ask questions and enhance your chances of achieving higher marks in both assignments and exams. I usually avoid to discuss new material during these review sessions.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion forums.</strong> There are three discussion forums available for us to interact and engage with one another. Each forum corresponds to a different part of the course: the first, second, and third partials. The benefit of the discussion forums is that everyone can track the progression of discussions and actively participate. The logical flow of ideas remains recorded, allowing you to receive my feedback and comments. Since our class sessions have limited time, we may occasionally utilize the discussion forums.</p>
<p><strong>Email.</strong> You are welcome to contact me via email at any time: <tt><code>&lt;martin.lozano@udem.edu&gt;</code></tt>. I also send group emails containing important information, so ensure that my email address is not marked as spam. If there is ever a delay in my response to an email or any other request, please feel free to insist and kindly remind me.</p>
<p><strong>Meetings.</strong> Whether it is face-to-face or virtual learning, we can schedule 30-minute Zoom online meetings if you require additional assistance or have any other issues you would like to discuss with me. These meetings can be arranged either individually or in groups. Simply send an email to <tt><code>&lt;martin.lozano@udem.edu&gt;</code></tt> to inquire about my availability. I ask that meetings be arranged by email so that I have written evidence of the arrangement and the necessary time to check my schedule before confirming available hours. If my initial availability does not work for you, feel free to let me know, I can offer alternative times until we find a mutually convenient slot. If you need more time, we can arrange for additional meetings or extend the duration as needed. Here is the Zoom link for meetings: <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/9209945512">https://us02web.zoom.us/j/9209945512</a>. The student or the group may request that the Zoom meeting be recorded, and I can share the recording with them for future reference. For the class session Zoom link, refer to the course calendar: <a href="#sec-schedule" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;7</a>.</p>
<p><strong>DataCamp</strong> DataCamp is an online learning platform focused on data science and analytics. It offers interactive courses in Python, R, SQL, and other tools commonly used in data analysis, machine learning, and statistics. Users learn by writing and running code directly in the browser, with instant feedback and guided exercises. You have free and full access as my student this semester.</p>
<p><a id="sec-dcp" href=""></a> <i class="fa-file-signature fa-solid" role="presentation" aria-label="fa-file-signature icon" style="color: red;"></i> DataCamp policies.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We rely on DataLab, which is part of DataCamp, for completing homework assignments and exams (see <a href="#sec-activities" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;5</a>). These platforms are not only essential for completing tasks and exams but also serve as the official means for submitting and turning them in. However, these platforms are not immune to occasional downtime. For this reason you must have RStudio installed on your local computer, which will allow you to have a backup to continue your work in case of an emergency.</li>
<li>All homework assignments and exams submissions, must be sent directly within the DataLab environment in the form of Jupyter notebooks (<tt><code>.ipynb</code></tt>). Although DataLab technically allows uploads in formats such as PDF or MS Word, these formats are not acceptable for evaluated homework or exams in this course. You are required to complete your work directly in the provided Jupyter notebook environment to ensure consistency and proper evaluation of your submissions.</li>
<li>In my experience, my students create and work with various documents and folders within DataLab. For convenience, I have created a folder called âsubmissionsâ in your group workspace, where you, as students, will place the documents I need to evaluate as assignments and exams. My instruction is not to rename this folder, and to use it so that I can easily identify the documents I need to assess and grade.</li>
<li>DataLab and Jupyter Notebooks may be new tools for some students, so it is important to pay close attention when submitting exams and assignments. All activities must be submitted in the correct workspace, which is identified by the group name and the correct folder called âsubmissionsâ. Submitting an activity in the wrong location, even if the work is completed, will be treated as not delivered. No exceptions will be made for submissions placed in incorrect folders or workspaces.</li>
<li>After completing your final exam <span class="math inline">\(E_F\)</span>, you will no longer have editor access to DataLab. Therefore, I suggest that you create a backup of any documents you wish to keep.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Book.</strong> The book (or books) is one of the main pillars of this course. In my experience, learning primarily occurs through reading and then reinforcing the concepts through practical application, although there are various other activities included in this course. The authors of the book are esteemed experts in their respective fields: John C. Hull from <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>; Frank Fabozzi from <a href="https://carey.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins Carey Business School</a>; Richard A. Brealey from <a href="https://www.london.edu/">London Business School</a>; Stewart C. Myers from <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/">Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>; Franklin Allen from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>; Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos from <a href="https://www.monash.edu/">Monash University</a>; ad Eugene F. Brigham and Joel F. Houston from <a href="https://www.ufl.edu/">University of Florida</a>. These books are not only suitable for intermediate and advanced undergraduate degrees but also for first-year masterâs degrees. I prefer using the original versions of the books rather than translations because, in my experience, the translations may not always match the quality of the original English version and, in some cases, may not be available.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorials.</strong> I have created a series of specialized online tutorials that provide step-by-step instructions on implementing various topics and estimating financial and economic models using data. These tutorials aim to help you bridge the gap between the theoretical concepts presented in the textbook and the practical implementation in R code. This approach, often referred to as literate programming, allows for a seamless transition. You can access my tutorials in my GitHub public repository <a href="https://github.com/mlozanoqf">https://github.com/mlozanoqf</a>, or more easily via GitHub Pages: <a href="https://mlozanoqf.github.io/">Quantitative Finance with R</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Others</strong>. All learning resources described above represent a good resource for your own study of the course material. There are plenty of Internet resources that you will have to use, from databases, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> videos, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> public repositories, specialized programming blogs, AI tools, books, electronic books, etc. See the resource list at the end of this document for further details. You are encouraged to read articles, reports and news on your own to enhance and expand your understanding about how theoretical concepts relate with current real-life events. <a href="https://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/">The Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/">The Guardian</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/">MarketWatch</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.bea.gov/">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.banxico.org.mx/">Banxico</a>, <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/">Project Syndicate</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/">El Financiero</a> (MÃ©xico), <a href="https://www.elconfidencial.com/">El Confidencial</a> (Spain), <a href="https://www.oecd.org/">OECD</a>, are a good way to grasp contemporary insights related with this course. Other references to support your learning process include economic and financial reports from private banks such as Banamex and BBVA, and think tanks websites such as <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/program/mexico-institute">The Mexico Institute</a>, <a href="https://mexicocomovamos.mx/">MÃ©xico cÃ³mo vamos</a>, <a href="http://cidac.org/">CIDAC</a>, <a href="https://imco.org.mx/">IMCO</a>, <a href="https://www.consejomexicano.org/">COMEXI</a>, among many others. My advice in this respect is rather simple: <em>the more you read the more you learn</em>.</p>

<p>In case you have any concern, any question about the course contents, or if you are having trouble understanding the course material, you have to contact me as soon as possible. This is your own responsibility starting from day 1. We can arrange an online meeting, or we can solve your questions or concerns by email, whatever is best. In case you are having a poor academic performance and you are genuinely interested to improve, my best advice is to contact me during the lecture period, not after the last session of the semester, and we can discuss specific strategies that can potentially help you to get higher marks and reduce the risk of failing the course. The point here is that you have to know that I can help you to improve your academic performance during the semester only if you are truly interested. If you would like to improve your marks at a later stage, or after the final exam, then I am afraid I can do nothing for you, but I can do a lot during the semester. Please email me in case you would like to arrange an appointment, my full contact details are at the beginning of this syllabus. The email is definitely the best way to initially approach me.</p>
<p>In case you get a low mark in one activity or you get difficulties at some specific topic you should take immediate actions in order to quickly revert this. I am not planning to relax the marking criterion so what you have to do is to improve your own quality standards in order to pass given my marking standards and my expectations about your academic performance. You are free to contact me in case you need assistance about specific strategies to improve your academic performance.</p>
<p>I do not recommend you to get disappointed, angry or sad if you get a low mark. There is no need for that because getting one low mark is not determinant to fail the course. Please see the evaluation method to verify how the final grade is computed and you will be amazed in a positive way. Also, I do not recommend you to get frustrated if you receive an unexpected low mark or an unexpected negative feedback about your work or your answers. The mechanics here are very simple: <em>in order to improve, understand and learn, you need to know what you did well, what you did wrong, and try again until you do well without getting desperate or frustrated in the process</em>. In short, avoid negative feelings as these might lead to further frustration. Nobody wants to hurt you, we all want you to learn in a favorable environment. You have overcome challenges before, so avoid the dark side <svg aria-hidden="true" role="img" viewbox="0 0 384 512" style="height:1em;width:0.75em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:currentColor;overflow:visible;position:relative;"><path d="M40.1 467.1l-11.2 9c-3.2 2.5-7.1 3.9-11.1 3.9C8 480 0 472 0 462.2V192C0 86 86 0 192 0S384 86 384 192V462.2c0 9.8-8 17.8-17.8 17.8c-4 0-7.9-1.4-11.1-3.9l-11.2-9c-13.4-10.7-32.8-9-44.1 3.9L269.3 506c-3.3 3.8-8.2 6-13.3 6s-9.9-2.2-13.3-6l-26.6-30.5c-12.7-14.6-35.4-14.6-48.2 0L141.3 506c-3.3 3.8-8.2 6-13.3 6s-9.9-2.2-13.3-6L84.2 471c-11.3-12.9-30.7-14.6-44.1-3.9zM160 192a32 32 0 1 0 -64 0 32 32 0 1 0 64 0zm96 32a32 32 0 1 0 0-64 32 32 0 1 0 0 64z"></path></svg>. On the contrary, you should rather work harder to meet the course standards. We are not in conflict, in fact we are collaborating. According to my experience, students who sadly fail this course ignore or forget these recommendations.</p>
<p>As a student, you may have different responsibilities. You are probably working, you might have family commitments, other courses, unexpected workload, troubles, and other diverse duties. All these may affect your academic performance at some time. My view here is that you are expected to do well in all aspects of your life and you will have to manage your time effectively and be productive. I hope you can allocate your time in such a way that you can pass this course and do well in the rest of your personal activities. Sometimes the workload is so intense that you have to evaluate whether you need to drop an activity to do well in the rest and keep you healthy, physically and mentally. If you find yourself overwhelmed by your personal troubles, workload and responsibilities, please ask for help, the university has professionals that can help you with this. If you have personal problems I can hear you and if I am unable to guide you properly, we can ask for professional help. Keep this in mind, we all care about your health, and health is far more important than a job, a course, and the university.</p>

<p>We all know that good grades do not necessarily make you a good person or a good professional. One could have difficulties at school but have such a good professional network, or an impressive ability to do business, or an impressive entrepreneurship spirit. However, grades are still quite useful to assess how well you are at meeting some academic standards and how well you manage to understand the relevant topics in your area of expertise. It is more important to be a good person than a good professional, and the graded activities are specifically designed to partially evaluate your technical abilities as a professional. Then, we all assume that you are a good person, and the course activities will help us to evaluate some of the required skills and competences as professionals. Having said that, I hope you can achieve high grades in this course.</p>
<p>Easter egg. The first three students who read this and send a photo of a cat wearing glasses to my email before August 20 will receive +5 marks on their next partial exam. If using a real cat, please ensure the animal is not harmed or distressed in any way.</p>
<p>In sum, I expect the best academic performance you can achieve, not the average, and definitely not the minimum. This should not be a surprise since you are studying at one of the most prestigious private universities in the country (we belong to a business school with AACSB and AMBA accreditation). If you succeed at delivering your best performance in this course, and I believe you can, then you might be in a better position to eventually tackle business problems including the most interesting and valuable ones which includes those that do not exist yet. I am sure you have done some extraordinary things in the past, you have overcome very hard challenges, so take this course just as another opportunity to unleash your full potential and show me how committed you are with your academic professional training.</p>
<p>I strongly believe you can learn anything just as this video from Khan Academy indicates:</p>

<p>Learning activities are structured tasks or exercises designed to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and understanding in an educational context. They are intended to promote active engagement, deepen understanding, and support the achievement of specific learning objectives.</p>
<p>The learning activities are classified into graded, non-graded, and extra marks categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graded activities are two assignments <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>, two partial exams <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> and one final exam <span class="math inline">\(E_F\)</span>, which account for 100% of your final grade and all of them are group activities.</li>
<li>Extra marks are awarded as a bonus to your next partial exams or final exam, so completing extra marks activities increases the maximum mark possible. These are optional and individual activities.</li>
<li>Non-graded activities are relevant for your learning but are not included in the grading process. Therefore, failure to complete them will not result in any mark deduction. These are optional and individual activities.</li>

\]</span> Of most frustration to students is receiving the same mark as their fellow non-contributing group members despite producing much of the groupâs work. In order to avoid this free-rider problem you will have to answer two coevaluations, one for the first part of the course and one for the second part. The first coevaluation is used to calculate the individual marks of <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>; the second coevaluation is used to calculate the individual marks of <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>. coevaluation is so important that one student may fail simply because of his or her low contribution in the group. Sometimes students face mitigating circumstances, if that is the case you will have to discuss with your group because their marks may have a significant negative impact on your mark.</p>
<p>The coevaluation is as an effective tool to incentive or penalize the group members to work well and on time. As a professor, I am not always aware of who is working well within a group, but the coevaluation can help us to be fair and assign marks based on academic merits. I do not reveal specific details about how you co-evaluate your colleagues. So, your coevaluation details will remain anonymous. I cannot change the coevaluation, this is a mark assigned by your colleagues based on your performance and contribution. Then, there are many incentives aligned so the group should work well, otherwise the chances to get a low mark are high.</p>
<p>In this video, students from <a href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/">The University of Melbourne</a> share their thoughts on how to effectively work in teams.</p>

<p>Coevaluations are completed using a Google Form. I set up an example here: <a href="https://forms.gle/Rzd6Chv89X5HR4rWA" class="uri">https://forms.gle/Rzd6Chv89X5HR4rWA</a>. Feel free to access the link and fill out the form to get familiar about the process. The real link will be available in Blackboard.</p>
<p>In particular, you will have two Google Forms web links in Blackboard to complete your coevaluation, one for <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>, and one for <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>. You will receive a copy of your answers by email just as in any other Google form. A typical issue is that students are not able to open it, but that is because you need to log in using the university email address. There is coevaluation for <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span> since it is non-graded, and <span class="math inline">\(E_F\)</span> since classes are over by then.</p>

<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(E_F = G_{EF} + X_{EF}\)</span> because no coevaluation is applied to <span class="math inline">\(E_F\)</span>.</p>
<p>This criterion is significantly better compared with the traditional average as the higher exam and assignment marks weigh more than twice the lower marks (70% versus 30%).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some students who do badly in their first exam and/or their first homework assignment believe that everything is lost and they should drop the class. My view is that this is not an accurate view as the grading above allows you to have a very bad exam and/or homework assignment and still be in a good position to pass the course. For example, imagine that for some reason you have <span class="math inline">\(H_1=35\)</span>, but you manage to improve and get <span class="math inline">\(H_2=85\)</span>. In any other course you will have an average of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{35+85}{2}=60\)</span> <svg aria-hidden="true" role="img" viewbox="0 0 512 512" style="height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:currentColor;overflow:visible;position:relative;"><path d="M464 256A208 208 0 1 1 48 256a208 208 0 1 1 416 0zM256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0zM176.4 240a32 32 0 1 0 0-64 32 32 0 1 0 0 64zm192-32a32 32 0 1 0 -64 0 32 32 0 1 0 64 0zM184 328c-13.3 0-24 10.7-24 24s10.7 24 24 24H328c13.3 0 24-10.7 24-24s-10.7-24-24-24H184z"></path></svg>.

<p>All topics covered in this course will be evaluated in the exams. To achieve an outstanding final grade, I strongly recommend taking detailed notes throughout the semester. Completing the assignments is also excellent preparation for the exams, so I encourage you to start working on them as early as possible. Youâre always welcome to share your progress with me, Iâll be happy to provide feedback to help you improve.</p>

<p><strong>When?</strong> The exams will follow the schedule in the course calendar (<a href="#sec-schedule" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;7</a>), aligned with the universityâs official dates. Exams <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> will be 1.5-hour in-class activities, and <span class="math inline">\(E_F\)</span> will last 2 hours. In 3-hour class sessions, <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> will take place during the first part, followed by a review of the answers in the second. Homework assignments are due at 10:00 on the specified dates in the course calendar, with no late submissions accepted under any circumstances: missing, incorrect, empty, or corrupted files will result in a zero for the group. This policy is strict and non-negotiable, and itâs important to be aware, as every semester some students lose marks due to preventable oversights. Homework <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span> are due shortly before <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(E_F\)</span>, respectively. Low assignment grades are usually not because the tasks are too difficult, but because groups begin working on them just a few days before the deadline; planning ahead is strongly advised.</p>

<p><strong>What are typical questions?</strong> While past partial exams may be availableâsince I allow students to keep their copies, itâs important to keep in mind that the course content evolves and the questions change each semester. Still, reviewing older exams can help you understand the general format and types of questions. Exams often include tasks that require using R and/or Python, typically focused on analyzing and interpreting data or results. To help you prepare, we will have review sessions before each graded exams and homeworks assignments, and if more time is needed, we can continue discussions through the forum. Homework assignments will include applied, research-oriented questions that require writing code in R and/or Python, as well as learning new concepts and conducting independent research. However, you wonât be alone as you have access to many resources outlined in the syllabus, including my support through Zoom sessions, DataLab discussions, meetings and email.</p>
<p><strong>What are the mechanics?</strong> Exam instructions will be provided as a <tt><code>.ipynb</code></tt> Jupyter Notebook file, made available on Blackboard five minutes before the start of the class session, as scheduled in the course calendar. Once available, you must download the file and upload it to your groupâs DataLab workbook, where you and your teammates will collaborate online to complete the exam within the given time frame. Thereâs no need to submit the file separately as I have access to your DataLab and will make an electronic copy for grading. Be sure to finish before the deadline, as late work is not accepted. A few days later, youâll receive your groupâs grade along with comments. I may also silently monitor your progress during the exam via your notebook. The process for homework assignments is similar: once the instructions are posted on Blackboard, upload them to your groupâs DataLab workbook, complete the task online, and ensure everything is finalized before the deadline. I will make a copy for review and grading, and afterward, youâll receive your groupâs mark and feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Are we going to review the exam and homework assignment answers?</strong> Yes, after each exam, we will use the following class session (held via Zoom) to go over the questions and discuss correct approaches. This applies to <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>, but not to <span class="math inline">\(E_F\)</span> since classes end before the final exam results can be reviewed. Exam questions are open-ended, and there are often multiple correct ways to answer them, so we will explore a variety of valid responses and common mistakes. Some students may be used to questions with only one right answer, but that is not usually the case in this course. If more time is needed for review, we can continue the discussion on the forum, in DataLab, or through a meeting upon request. Reviewing your mistakes is an important way to learn and prepare for the final exam. For homework assignments, students receive immediate feedback during their presentations, and additional comments are available upon request.</p>
<p><strong>What if we fail to understand our own mistakes?</strong> Regardless of the activity, if you have any difficulty understanding your mistakes, it is expected that you reach out to me for clarification. In such cases, I may request you to attempt the questions again before we can discuss your specific mistakes in a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Do all group members receive the same mark?</strong> Not necessarily. Individual marks are adjusted based on coevaluation results. For example, even if a group receives a perfect score on the first homework <span class="math inline">\(G_{H1} = 100\)</span>, a student with a coevaluation score of <span class="math inline">\(C_{H1} = 0\)</span> would receive an individual mark of <span class="math inline">\(H_1 = 0\)</span>. Conversely, if the group mark is <span class="math inline">\(G_{H1} = 90\)</span> and a student receives a coevaluation of <span class="math inline">\(C_{H1} = 100\)</span>, their individual mark adjusts to <span class="math inline">\(H_1 = 93\)</span>. In short, your final mark reflects both the groupâs performance and your contribution. Additionally, exam marks may increase through participation in extra credit activities.</p>
<p><strong>Where?</strong> Physical presence in the classroom is not required for taking the exams. You can complete the exams from any location of your choice, as they are conducted, answered, and submitted entirely in electronic format. Just ensure that you and the rest of your group have a stable Internet connection. I can create Zoom rooms for your group to answer the exam if you wish. I will be available during the exams through Zoom, and while joining the Zoom session is not mandatory during exams, please be aware that I will be accessible in case you need any assistance. The Zoom link for the exams is the same as the one assigned to the course. It is important to note that for 3-hour class sessions, the first part of the session is dedicated to taking the exam. During the second part of the class, you will need to log in to the Zoom session to review and discuss the answers for the <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> exams. Logging in is required to register your attendance for this session.</p>
<p><strong>How many questions?</strong> For both <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>, there will be a total of 4 questions, out of which you are required to answer 3. This allows you the opportunity to choose the 3 questions that you feel most confident about. As for <span class="math inline">\(E_F\)</span>, there will be 5 questions, and you are expected to answer 4. All questions carry equal weight. It is important to note that if you answer all questions may result in a significant mark deduction, you only have to answer 3 out of 4 for partial exams and 4 out of 5 for the final exam. However, if you take the exam on a different date for any reason, your <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> will consist of 3 questions instead of 4. In this case, you will not have the advantage of leaving one exam question unanswered. The same principle applies to the <span class="math inline">\(E_F\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(E_F\)</span> covers all the topics and activities covered in the course. To ensure convenience, one question from <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and one question from <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> will be included in <span class="math inline">\(E_F\)</span> with minor modifications. This means that if you have prepared well for <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>, you should be able to answer at least 50% of the <span class="math inline">\(E_F\)</span> correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Can we open the textbook during the exam?</strong> Yes, you are allowed to use the Internet and all course materials during the exams. The purpose of the exams is to assess your reasoning, coding, and analytical skills rather than your ability to memorize concepts or perform Internet searches. The exam questions are designed in a way that the answers cannot be found online, in the textbook, or in a test bank. Even AI tools frequently fail to provide full correct answers because most of the time questions are very specific and data oriented. While the questions are based on the course material, they are typically new and original. However, it is important to note that you are expected to answer the exam on your own, with the assistance of your own group, which should consist of no more than 4 students.</p>
<!-- **Mock exams.** We may have one or more mock exams. These exams are similar to the regular exams as they can be taken without physical presence in the classroom. Mock exams provide an opportunity to become familiar with the examination process, logistics, and the level of difficulty of the graded exams. Mock exams are conducted as group activities, typically consisting of one or two questions. If your group answers the mock exam correctly (100% accuracy), you will receive 2 stickers (+10 marks) to be added to your next partial or final exam. However, if your group does not answer the mock exam correctly, you will lose 5 marks on your next partial or final exam. We will review the correct answers immediately during the same session. -->

<p>This section explains how your work will be evaluated in this course. Youâll find the grading rubric for oral presentations, the criteria used to assess your exams, and definitions of common instruction words used in assignments. Review these guidelines carefully to understand whatâs expected and how to prepare your submissions effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Homework assignments, oral presentation rubric.</strong></p>
<p>Each of the 5 criteria is worth 20 points, for a total of 100 points. The final assignment group grade is based entirely on the oral presentation. Written submissions must be delivered on time but are not directly graded. There is no late submission policy: submissions must be uploaded by the deadline through the group workspace in DataLab. Timely submission through the correct platform is a necessary condition for the assignment to be evaluated. In some cases, specific questions or components of an assignment may be evaluated under different or additional criteria. When this applies, it will be clearly stated in the assignment instructions.</p>

<p><strong>How exams will be evaluated.</strong></p>
<p>The following criteria will be used to assess your answers in both partial and final exams. They reflect the expectations regarding content, clarity, methodology, language, format, and academic integrity. Please review each item carefully and use them to guide how you prepare and structure your responses. Failing to meet these criteria may result in mark deductions or invalidation of your submission.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Relevance to the question requirements.</strong> Each exam question includes specific instructions regarding the nature of the response required. For example, the question may specify whether the answer must involve coding, explanation, interpretation, or another form of analysis. It is essential that you follow these instructions carefully. If the question requests an interpretation of results, providing only raw code or calculations without interpretation will be considered an incomplete or incorrect response. Likewise, if a question asks for a written explanation and the answer consists only of equations or numerical results, marks will be deducted. Ignoring the type of response expected may result in low or no credit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correctness and methodological accuracy.</strong> Your answers must demonstrate the correct application of theoretical concepts, formulas, and analytical methods introduced during the course. This includes implementing statistical or econometric procedures accurately, using proper assumptions, and applying models in appropriate contexts. Answers that include methodological mistakes, incorrect formulas, misapplied techniques, or unsupported reasoning will be penalized. Both accuracy in the process and correctness in the final outcome are important. In addition, formulas and equations should be properly formatted using Markdown, which is easily supported in Jupyter Notebooks. Clear mathematical notation helps ensure that your reasoning is understandable and professionally presented.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpretation and analytical insight.</strong> In addition to obtaining correct numerical or coded results, you must show that you understand their meaning. This involves interpreting figures, tables, estimation outputs, or theoretical implications correctly. A good answer explains what the results show, what they imply, and how they relate to the broader question. Superficial or incorrect interpretations, or answers that merely report numbers without context or insight, will receive lower marks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use of English language.</strong> All exams must be written in English. Responses submitted in other languages will not be evaluated. In addition to using English, it is important that your writing is grammatically correct and syntactically clear. Responses with poor grammar, fragmented sentences, or language errors that obscure meaning may receive fewer marks, even if the technical content is sound.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarity and organization.</strong> Your answer should be well structured and logically organized. It should be easy to read and understand. This includes writing in complete sentences, presenting ideas in a coherent sequence, and clearly labeling key parts of the response, such as steps in a procedure or final conclusions. Avoid excessive jargon, unclear phrasing, or disorganized content. Answers that are confusing or hard to follow may receive lower marks, even if they contain correct elements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Completeness of the answer.</strong> An answer should address all parts of the question. Partial answers that omit key steps, relevant assumptions, or critical arguments will be penalized. For instance, if a question includes multiple subparts and you respond to only one, or if you present a final result without explaining how you obtained it, your answer will be considered incomplete. You are expected to provide full, coherent, and well-developed responses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code functionality and readability (when applicable).</strong> If a question requires coding, the code must be functional and should run without errors unless stated otherwise. In addition, the code should be readable, efficient, and annotated when necessary. Simply copying code from previous material without adapting it to the specific question is not acceptable. Points may be deducted if the code is incorrect, does not produce the expected output, is difficult to follow, or lacks basic explanations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use of course materials and concepts.</strong> Strong answers demonstrate your ability to connect your work to concepts, models, and tools discussed in the course. When appropriate, reference material from lectures, textbook figures or tables, or class examples to support your response. Doing so shows that you understand the broader context of the question. Answers that rely only on general intuition or personal opinion without grounding in course content are unlikely to receive high marks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exam validity: Group, time, and platform requirements.</strong> Exams must be completed according to the official conditions set by the instructor. In particular, all exams are to be taken in groups unless individual participation has been explicitly authorized in advance. You must submit the exam during the designated time period and through the required format. In this course, that means submitting your group response using the DataLab platform on DataCamp. Failure to meet these requirements may result in the submission being considered invalid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Academic integrity and similarity between groups.</strong> Although the exams are completed in groups and students are not physically monitored, academic integrity is strictly enforced. If two or more groups submit answers that are significantly similar, whether due to collaboration between groups, the use of AI tools that generate identical content, or other forms of misconduct, this will be treated as a serious academic offense. In such cases, a substantial mark deduction will apply and/or the matter may be referred to the university for formal investigation of plagiarism.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here, I define a few common verbs used in assignment and exam instructions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Define.</strong> State the precise meaning of a term or concept. Your response should be concise, accurate, and free from ambiguity, often including a formal or widely accepted definition.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Describe.</strong> Provide a detailed account of the characteristics or features of a concept, process, or phenomenon. Focus on âwhat it isâ and include relevant details, but avoid analysis or interpretation unless specified.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Explain.</strong> Clarify the âwhyâ or âhowâ of a concept or phenomenon. Provide reasoning, causes, or mechanisms to ensure the topic is fully understood, often using examples or logical arguments to support your answer.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Replicate.</strong> (e.g., replicate a figure or table). Reproduce a figure, table, or result from provided data or information using appropriate tools and methods. Ensure that the replication matches the original in terms of accuracy, formatting, and presentation.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Compare.</strong> Identify and discuss the similarities between two or more items, concepts, or processes. Highlight key points of resemblance and ensure the comparison is structured and focused.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Contrast.</strong> Identify and discuss the differences between two or more items, concepts, or processes. Highlight key points of distinction while maintaining a clear structure in your response.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate.</strong> Assess the strengths, weaknesses, or implications of a concept, argument, or result. Your answer should include a reasoned judgment supported by evidence or criteria, rather than mere opinion.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Analyze.</strong> Break down a topic or problem into its essential components to examine relationships, patterns, or underlying principles. Your response should include interpretation and insight based on evidence or logical reasoning.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Extend.</strong> (e.g., extend an analysis or model) Go beyond the original scope of an analysis or model by adding new elements, perspectives, or considerations. This could involve applying it to new data, proposing modifications, or exploring additional implications.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Estimate.</strong> Provide an approximate calculation, measurement, or judgment based on available data, information, or assumptions. Clearly state the method or reasoning used to arrive at your estimate and acknowledge its potential limitations.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Comment.</strong> Provide a brief but insightful observation or opinion on a topic, issue, or result. Your response should be concise and focused, offering interpretation, critique, or additional perspective without requiring extensive elaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Discuss.</strong> Explore a topic in depth by presenting a balanced argument or analysis. Your response should include multiple viewpoints, evidence, or examples, and may evaluate or interpret different aspects of the topic. A structured and thorough approach is expected.</li>
</ol>
<!-- The following list illustrates a typical generic rubric for graded activities. -->
<!-- **What is a very good answer?** Competent and well presented. The work is critical and comprehensive and has a degree of depth in presenting and considering the material. Integrates the concepts introduced and applies them to problems with some evidence of critical analysis. Provides clear and competent answers to the questions, written in good English. Clearly presents solutions to calculative questions and demonstrates very good analytic skills and understanding. -->
<!-- In this video, students from [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) give their tips on ways to improve your English. -->
<!-- ```{r echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- embed_url("https://youtu.be/NPwTgfswnD8") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- **What is an average answer?** Competent discussion of relevant material, but are largely descriptive and lack critical/analytic depth. Answers are well structured, well presented and demonstrate an average awareness of relevant material. Shows a basic understanding of concepts introduced but with limited ability to apply these concepts. Tends to miss the point of the question. Is written poorly, written in note form, lacks structure or is too short to properly address the question. -->
<!-- **What is a poor answer?** Work shows some weak understanding of the main elements of the course material. Shows very limited achievement of the relevant intended learning outcomes of the course. Has a weak understanding of fundamental concepts with no critical analysis. Produces answers that contain factual or conceptual inadequacies or inadequate analytic skills. Provides poorly written answers that fail to address the question, or answers that are too brief to answer the question properly. Shows a confusing or wrong math notation as e^-rT instead of $e^{-rT}$, this is wrong because as in chemistry as we do not write H2O, we write $H_2O$. -->
<!-- You have to realize as soon as possible that you are being evaluated all the time, so every answer provided by you either in exams, assignments or even verbally during class should be clearly stated, showing your full thought-process, this will allow me to understand your own logic and grade your work fairly. Please do not forget this point as this will allow us to keep the academic quality standards high throughout the semester. -->
<!-- Following the assignment and exam instructions are important to get full marks.  -->
<!-- This is a complementary rubric for some kind of quantitative assignments. -->
<!-- **Criterion 1: Comments and explanations in the code.** -->
<!-- | Level.            | Description.                                                                                                               | -->
<!-- |------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| -->
<!-- | 3. Complete (86 â 100).  | The code is well-documented with clear comments explaining the key sections. The explanations in English are well-written, logically structured, and demonstrate a solid understanding of what is being done and its purpose. The comments show not only an understanding of what is being done but also why it is done this way, reflecting an advanced understanding of design decisions. | -->
<!-- | 2. Adequate (70 â 85).   | The code includes some comments, but several key sections are missing them. The explanations in English are understandable, although they may have minor errors or lack consistency in the logical flow. The understanding of the purpose is adequate but not deep. The comments are sufficient but do not delve into the design decisions or the justification for the implementations. | -->
<!-- | 1. Insufficient (0 â 69).| The code has few or no comments, and the explanations in English are minimal, poorly written, or nonexistent. There is no clear demonstration of understanding of what is being done or its purpose. The absence or scarcity of comments makes the code difficult for others to understand, affecting the quality of the report. | -->
<!-- --- -->
<!-- **Criterion 2: Quality of analysis.** -->
<!-- | Level.            | Description.                                                                                                               | -->
<!-- |------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| -->
<!-- | 3. Ambitious & in-depth (86 â 100).  | The analysis is original, ambitious, and thoroughly developed. It fulfills all the activity instructions, is clear, detailed, and well-grounded. The solution presented is creative, well-structured, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem. The analysis is not only in-depth and ambitious but also anticipates and addresses possible problems or limitations in the proposed solution. | -->
<!-- | 2. Adequate (70 â 85).   | The analysis is relevant and meets most of the activity instructions. It is clear and detailed but may lack depth or creativity. The solution presented is correct but does not stand out for its originality or thorough justification. The analysis is adequate but may not fully explore all possible alternatives or implications of the solution. | -->
<!-- | 1. Insufficient (0 â 69).| The analysis deviates from the activity instructions, is superficial, or is limited to reproducing the study material without contributing original ideas. The solution presented is incomplete, poorly justified, or incorrect. The lack of in-depth analysis suggests limited understanding of the problem or possible solutions. | -->
<!-- --- -->
<!-- **Criterion 3: Report structure.** -->
<!-- | Level.            | Description.                                                                                                               | -->
<!-- |------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| -->
<!-- | 3. Clear & logical (86 â 100).  | The report is well-organized with clear sections and subsections. The structure is logical and facilitates understanding of the results. The writing is clear, and the content is well-presented, prioritizing quality and clarity. The logical structure of the report highlights key points of the analysis, making it easy for the reader to follow. | -->
<!-- | 2. Adequate (70 â 85).   | The report is organized but may lack some necessary subsections or have a structure that is not always easy to follow. The writing is generally clear, though some parts may be confusing. A less clear structure may weaken the arguments and make the presentation of results more challenging. | -->
<!-- | 1 â Confusing & disorganized (0 â 69).| The report lacks a logical structure, with confusing or poorly organized sections. The writing is difficult to follow, compromising the understanding of the results. The report is lengthy but lacks clarity and quality in its content. A confusing structure not only hinders comprehension but also undermines a fair evaluation of the work presented. | -->
<!-- **Criterio 1: Comentarios y explicaciones en el cÃ³digo.** -->
<!-- | Nivel            | DescripciÃ³n                                                                                                               | -->
<!-- |------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| -->
<!-- | **3 â Completo (86 â 100)**  | El cÃ³digo estÃ¡ bien documentado con comentarios claros que explican las secciones clave. Las explicaciones en inglÃ©s son bien redactadas, con un hilo conductor lÃ³gico, y demuestran un sÃ³lido entendimiento de lo que se estÃ¡ haciendo y su propÃ³sito. Los comentarios demuestran no solo un entendimiento de lo que se estÃ¡ haciendo, sino tambiÃ©n de por quÃ© se hacen de esa manera, mostrando una comprensiÃ³n avanzada de las decisiones de diseÃ±o. | -->
<!-- | **2 â Adecuado (70 â 85)**   | El cÃ³digo incluye algunos comentarios, pero faltan en varias secciones clave. Las explicaciones en inglÃ©s son comprensibles, aunque pueden tener errores menores o falta de coherencia en el hilo conductor. El entendimiento del propÃ³sito es adecuado pero no profundo. Los comentarios son suficientes pero no profundizan en las decisiones de diseÃ±o o en la justificaciÃ³n de las implementaciones. | -->
<!-- | **1 â Insuficiente (0 â 69)**| El cÃ³digo tiene pocos o ningÃºn comentario, y las explicaciones en inglÃ©s son mÃ­nimas, mal redactadas, o inexistentes. No se demuestra un entendimiento claro de lo que se estÃ¡ haciendo ni de su propÃ³sito. La ausencia o escasez de comentarios hace que el cÃ³digo sea difÃ­cil de entender para terceros, afectando la calidad del reporte. | -->

<p>Extra marks activities are individual tasks. As with any extra marks activity, you will not lose points if you fail to complete them, but you can earn additional marks if you complete them on time. For each DataCamp and <a href="https://www.uncclearn.org/">UN CC:Learn</a> course completed on time, you will receive a nice PDF certificate, which looks great on your CV and LinkedIn profile.</p>
<!-- [^6]: Please note that DataCamp is not the only alternative to learn R. There are other free alternatives available in the web such as [Swirl.](https://swirlstats.com/) You can find many free electronic resources to learn R in the reference section at the end of this syllabus. There are also some students who find the tutorials (developed by myself) a good enough resource to learn R. However, there are other students who need more specialized courses, or more basic courses to understand the logic of programming in R and some other extensions. In my attempt to offer you as many free and useful resources as possible, you have a DataCamp account. According to Martijn Theuwissen Co-founder and COO at DataCamp, they are no.1 ranked Forbes certifications. -->
<p><strong>DataCamp.</strong> You can earn extra marks for your next <span class="math inline">\(G_{E1}, G_{E1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_{E1}\)</span> exams group marks by completing DataCamp assignments, which involve accumulating a specific amount of XP. XP is a measure of your engagement within DataCamp, automatically calculated based on the courses, exercises, or other content you complete. For more details, refer to the DataCamp Assignments section and the course calendar, where they are marked with the <em>extra marks</em> tag. The deadline is 10:00 on the date indicated in the course calendar. Since XP is calculated automatically, you do not need to submit any certificates, screenshots, or other evidence. Just make sure to complete the assignment on time.</p>
<p>The amount of extra marks is based on the cumulative number of DataCamp assignments completed during the semester. There are 9 DataCamp assignments in total, allocated as 3 in the first partial, 3 in the second, and 3 in the third. Each assignment consists of accumulating 10,000 XP in DataCamp courses. For each assignment completed, you earn <span class="math inline">\(f(n) = p_n\)</span> extra marks on the total number of assignments completed, where <span class="math inline">\(p_n\)</span> represents the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th prime number and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the count of completed assignments. The function domain is <span class="math inline">\(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\)</span> and the range is <span class="math inline">\(\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then, if you complete all of them on time, you will earn:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X_{E1}=f(3) = 5\)</span> extra marks over your <span class="math inline">\(G_{E1}\)</span>, which represents +2 over your final grade <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X_{E2}=f(6) = 13\)</span> extra marks over your <span class="math inline">\(G_{E2}\)</span>, which represents +5.2 over your final grade <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X_{EF}=f(9) = 23\)</span> extra marks over your <span class="math inline">\(G_{EF}\)</span>, which represents +6.9 over your final grade <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, if you complete all 9 extra marks DataCamp assignments on time (90,000 XP) you will get +14.1 over your final grade <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.</p>
<p>To complete the XP assignments, you will need to choose courses, skill tracks, career tracks, practice exercises, and other types of DataCamp content on your own. You are free to select based on your personal interests and preferences. However, if you would like some guidance, I recommend starting with basic or fundamental R programming courses, data visualization in R, as well as finance courses with R. Other options include Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, ChatGPT, and more. Visit the âLearnâ section on DataCamp to browse, search, and filter all available learning content to accumulate XP. Feel free to contact me if you would like further advice on which courses to take.</p>
<!-- **DataCamp assessments.** DataCamp assessments are individual activities that allow you to get extra marks over your final grade $F$. Yes, over your final grade. These are time-limit online evaluations of your knowledge of R and Python. DataCamp marks your assessment as N (novice), I (intermediate), and A (advanced) depending on your own performance. The rule to allocate the extra marks over your final grade $F$ is the following: 0 for N; +1 for I; and +2 for A. Assessments will be available in your DataCamp Assignments section and in the course calendar as *super extra marks* tag. Assessments are completed during the class session and although DataCamp allows you to complete the assessment twice, I will take your first try as your grade. -->
<p><strong>DataCamp top 5 XP for the first 30, 60, and 90 days.</strong> DataCamp has a leaderboard that ranks participants based on the amount of XP they earn. I will assign +5 extra marks to the top 5 students with the highest XP during three specific time ranges: the first 30 days, days 31 to 60, and days 61 to 90 of the semester. The allocation of these extra marks will be recorded according to the course calendar.</p>
<p>The dates on which I will assign these marks according to the DataCamp leaderboard are: Wednesday, September 3; Friday, October 3; and Monday, November 3.</p>
<p><strong>UN CC:Learn courses.</strong> You can earn extra marks for your next <span class="math inline">\(G_{E1}, G_{E2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_{EF}\)</span> exams group marks by completing <a href="https://www.uncclearn.org/">UN CC:Learn</a> courses, which are listed in the course calendar under the <em>extra marks</em> tag. The deadline is 10:00 on the date indicated in the course calendar. Please note that UN CC:Learn courses may require a minimum score to obtain a valid certificate.</p>
<p>Some students may have completed a UN CC:Learn course in the past. If your certificate is older than the starting date of the current academic term, it is not valid, and you will need to choose a different course to substitute it.</p>
<p>There are 3 UN CC:Learn activities in the semester, allocated as 1 in the first term, 1 in the second, and 1 in the third. You will earn +5 extra marks for each completed course. In case you complete them on time, these extra marks over your <span class="math inline">\(G_{E1}, G_{E2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_{EF}\)</span> represent +5.5 over your final grade <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. Students who complete the three UN CC:Learn and the 90,000 XP DataCamp assignments will get +19.6 over their final grade <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.</p>
<p>As with DataCamp, you are expected to choose the UN CC:Learn course based on your own interests and preferences. Visit the course section to browse the full catalog.</p>
<p><strong>Stickers.</strong> There are some opportunities throughout the semester to get extra marks. In this course, extra marks are allocated in the form of stickers, every sticker stands for 5 extra marks on your <span class="math inline">\(G_{E1}, G_{E2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_{EF}\)</span> exams group marks. They are called <em>stickers</em> because I give real stickers to my students. Stickers are assigned by merit. It is not very easy to get a sticker, but it is worth a try. The record so far is one student who got 30 extra marks over the <span class="math inline">\(G_{EF}\)</span>, and he passed the course partially because of that.</p>
<p><strong>The wheel of fortune.</strong> I spin a virtual wheel of fortune three times during the semester to randomly allocate extra marks to a lucky group of students. Attendance in these sessions is mandatory to claim the extra marks if you are selected by the wheel. In total, you could earn +0, +5, or +10 extra marks for your next <span class="math inline">\(G_{E1}, G_{E2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_{EF}\)</span> exams group marks.</p>
<p><strong>Mentimeter.</strong> We may have a few sessions that include a Mentimeter activity. This activity may be evaluated, and if it is, the top 10 best answers will earn extra marks. Points will be awarded based on your rank in the top 10: the first place earns +10, the second place earns +9, and so on, with the tenth place earning +1 extra marks for your next <span class="math inline">\(G_{E1}, G_{E2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_{EF}\)</span> exams group marks.</p>

<p><strong>DataCamp webinars.</strong> You are free to attend live webinars organized by DataCamp. See the <em>live events</em> DataCamp section for the upcoming webinars in this semester. Please note that you have to register to attend. Let me know which ones you are planning to attend.</p>
<p><strong>Videos.</strong> You can record and submit one video per period (up to one per partial exam). This is an individual non-graded activity, in Spanish. The submission of this activity is by the discussion forum. I recommend you to upload the video as a YouTube link or any other similar platform so you can submit only the web url in the discussion forum. I would like to avoid others downloading the video, so I believe sharing the link is the best way to submit it. By sharing the video url will allow you to delete your video after the semester ends if you wish. The design of the video and the length is free although you have to start by introducing yourself and the course name.</p>
<p>There are four types of videos.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type 1: Feynman.</strong> The Feynman technique for teaching and communication is a mental model (a breakdown of a personal thought process) to convey information using concise thoughts and simple language. The Feynman model is named after the Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, who was recognized as someone who could clearly explain complex topics in a way that everybody â even those without degrees in the sciences â could understand. He was also named <em>The Smartest Man in the World</em> in 1979. According to him: <em>The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.</em> There are four simple steps to the Feynman technique: (1) choose a concept; (2) teach it to a toddler; (3) identify gaps and go back to the source material; (4) review and simplify. Teaching it to a toddler should not take it literally, it basically means that your explanation should be as clear and simple as a toddler could understand it.</li>
</ul>

<!-- **Discussion forums.** -->
<!-- Discussion forums are a good opportunity to discuss topics further while keeping track of ideas, procedures, results and conclusions. The use of discussion forums represent an extension of the class session and learning activities. My advice is to read the course material to be prepared for the discussion forum questions. My view is that discussion forums are not a repository of individual answers but an opportunity to conduct a proper discussion. Then, please make sure that every time you post a contribution you read the current state of the discussion so you can add value to it. We also use the discussion forums as an open space to ask me questions about the course contents. Please subscribe to the discussion forum so you can receive email notifications. This is convenient because I normally do not announce new discussions. There is no fixed frequency for this activity, most of the time it depends on the students interests. You should add your picture in the settings so we can easily match face with name. This is an individual non-graded activity, in Spanish. -->
<p><strong>Why is <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span> a non-graded activity?</strong> The <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span> is a special assignment that is designed to help you to practice and study for your final exam by learning from your previous mistakes. It has a deadline but it is a non-graded activity. Given that it is non-graded, this activity is optional. The <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span> instructions are the following: You are required to (1) correct all your mistakes in all your previous graded activities, including all the four <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> questions, and assignments; and (2) complete all your missed extra mark activities, mostly from DataCamp and <a href="https://www.uncclearn.org/">UN CC:Learn</a>. The format and delivery is the same as the rest of the assignments. You can do it in group or individually. You will not receive <span class="math inline">\(H_3\)</span> feedback as by then you will have access to all exam and assignment answers. In any case, you can ask me to review it if necessary.</p>

<p>As a student in this course and more broadly, as a member of the academic community, you are expected to respect the rules outlined in this syllabus and in the universityâs academic regulations. These rules are not arbitrary; they exist to ensure fairness, transparency, and equity for everyone enrolled in the course.</p>
<p>At times, students may feel that their personal situation warrants an exception to one of these rules. It is important to understand that, even when such requests are made sincerely and in good faith, they are, in effect, asking for different treatment from that received by others, which amounts to altering the rules.</p>
<p>I recognize that such requests often do not come from a desire for unfair advantage, but from a genuine belief that the exception is reasonable. However, this often involves what is known as a <em>special pleading fallacy</em> assuming that a general rule should not apply in a particular case without an objective or institutional justification. It can also reflect a form of <em>motivated reasoning</em>, in which one interprets a situation in a way that aligns with what one wishes to be true.</p>
<p>I also understand that students may sometimes argue: <em>Yes, I understand the rules, but whatâs happening to me is unfair, and I have the right to have my case considered.</em> As your instructor, I will always listen respectfully to your concerns. Being heard is a right. However, being heard does not guarantee that an exception can be granted. My responsibility is to apply rules consistently to ensure fairness across the board. Making individual exceptions, even with the best intentions, could compromise that fairness and create new forms of injustice toward others.</p>
<p>My commitment is to be clear, respectful, and fair with each of you. In return, I expect every student to approach their responsibilities with maturity, understanding that the rules are not obstacles, but essential parts of the learning environment we all share.</p>
<p>Please consider the following checklist to improve the chances to achieve a good performance in this course.</p>

<li>If you consider learning how to code is very difficult and you think you need more practice, then take all the <a href="https://swirlstats.com/">Swirl</a> and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">DataCamp</a> courses that you want or need. I teach a course of R every year, and you can also contact me if you need further help. You are expected to learn new things, and this is only one of them.</li>
<li>If I ever take longer than expected to answer an email or any other request, please insist and kindly remind me.</li>
<li>Always keep academic quality standards high for your own work and overall course performance. Find your own motivation and keep a regular weekly progress to study the course material in advance.</li>
<li>If you fail one activity do not get angry or upset as this is the best way to frustration. You better do the activity again by yourself the best way you can. You may say <em>how can I do it again if I failed?</em> Well, just remember we have one class session in which we discuss the correct exam and homework assignment answers, so look at your class notes again because you will find the answers there. Once you do that, you are free to contact me to comment on your work or to verify that now you know how to do it correctly. Most of the students who sadly fail this class ignore this recommendation because they are truly convinced that they do not understand or get frustrated because they fail to understand in the first attempts. Try and try again, eventually you will get it.</li>
<li>If you have trouble with your group members because they fail to work under the basic standards, and you consider it unfair to include their names in the assignment cover sheet, remember you can co-evaluate them with 0 to activate a straight penalty in his or her mark. Your homework assignment co-evaluation will remain anonymous.</li>
<li>Never get frustrated for too long because there will be no challenge that you cannot overcome with the right amount of time and effort. If after all you get frustrated, upset, or angry, do not let it happen too frequently and do not let it last for long. Ask for help whenever you need it, and remember you are free to contact me.</li>
<li>Remember the evaluation method is particularly beneficial for students because of how the average is calculated. Instead of simply averaging the grades, I use a weighted system for both assignments and partial exams. For each category, the lower grade is weighted at 30% and the higher grade at 70%. This approach ensures that stronger performance is given greater importance, encouraging improvement and rewarding effort.</li>
<li>If you would like to share something (anything) with me, feel free to do so. My email is: <tt><code>&lt;martin.lozano@udem.edu&gt;</code></tt>.</li>
<li>Follow number 1.</li>

<p>In principle, as we are using Deepnote, you do not need to install any software on your computer. However, you may be interested to work with R on your local computer. Here is a good list of YouTube installation guides to do so.</p>
<p>As you may understand, R and RStudio versions are frequently updated and people regularly upload installation guides on YouTube.

<!-- ## RStudio and GitHub integration plus pull request (PR). -->
<!-- GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code and projects. GitHub is one of the world's largest communities of open source code developers. It fosters collaboration and communication between developers similar to a social network of coders. Here, we assume you have installed R, RStudio, Git, and you have a GitHub account. This series of videos are good to understand the basics of how professionals develop code in a collaborative way. -->
<!-- **Video 1 of 4.** I recommend you to start at minute 10. Before minute 10 you can see an installation process, but there are better videos in the previous section (YouTube installation guides). Starting from minute 10 you can learn how to link RStudio with your GitHub account using the SSH RSA key which I highly recommend. You may find Samsun's voice speed a bit slow, just remember you can change the playback speed in YouTube if necessary. [Installing R, R Studio, and link R Studio with Github account - Part 4 - by Samsun.](https://youtu.be/-LKFxtaU5bY) -->
<!-- **Video 2 of 4.** The relevant part starts at minute 5:50. In the first part Lisa explains how to use the `{usethis}` library to link RStudio with your GitHub account, but I recommend you to follow the video 1 for that purpose. So, please watch this from minute 5:50 to the end. There is one more thing, in 8:39 she clones with HTTPS, but I recommend you cloning with SSH, the option to select SSH is just right there in the same window. In my experience, cloning with SSH is better because of security issues and because you may not be asked to log in repeatedly. [Using git and GitHub in R Studio.](https://youtu.be/QLFc9gw_Hfs) -->
<!-- **Video 3 of 4.** Video 2 explained RStudio and GitHub integration to work alone. This video 3 explains how to work with others as collaborators (Lisa and Heather). In the context of this class, your classmate colleagues are collaborators, I am not included as a collaborator. Note that Lisa and Heather cloned with HTTPS but I recommend cloning with SSH. They show how to work with branches and pull request between collaborators. Starting from 30:40 the tutorial is somewhat less interesting, you are free to look at it, but it is not vital for our purposes. [Using Git and GitHub in R (second part).](https://youtu.be/megZYkCLMA4) -->
<!-- **Video 4 of 4.** Layla explains very well how to interact between a team of students and your professor or instructor. Note that her RStudio panes are in a very weird location but I guess you still can follow. Layla also recommends working with branches, this is a good practice. She also knits in html but I will ask you to knit in pdf most of the time. Note that she actually takes the side of the students who are interacting with an instructor which is called reviewer in GitHub. [Branching and Committing from RStudio and creating a PR on GitHub.](https://youtu.be/4Jjk_43g9xU) -->
<!-- **Complementary video.** This is in Spanish, it is a good video, but the previous 4 are somewhat better. She links RStudio and GitHub using the terminal, I normally follow the procedure in the first video (Samsun's video). She also clones with HTTPS, but I recommend you cloning with SSH as I explained before. [RStudio y GitHub: control de versiones. ](https://youtu.be/Xy_CLr7htfA) -->
